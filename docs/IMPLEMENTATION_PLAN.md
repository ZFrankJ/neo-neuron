# Implementation Plan

Strict execution contract for Issue #2 backend parity work.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/ZFrankJ/neo-neuron/issues/2

## Current State

```text
main == origin/main
HEAD 1e0e21a docs: close active parity queue
```

MLX is the frozen scientific reference backend. Existing clean MLX result rows outside this repo remain authoritative.

The dependency reproducibility maintenance slice constrains macOS Apple Silicon
MLX parity installs to a tested package stack. MLX runtime semantics and strict
parity thresholds remain unchanged.

The completed local alignment queue established MLX reference parity, optimizer parity, public training-loop parity, checkpoint metadata guards, CI, a seed optional MPS probe, a shared backend parity audit report helper, MPS short training trajectory parity, MPS memory slope classification, and skip-safe CUDA harness preparation. The research goal is now blocked on real Nvidia GPU access for CUDA validation:

```text
MLX reference
  -> PyTorch CPU semantic bridge
  -> PyTorch MPS no-checkpoint parity
  -> PyTorch CUDA parity only after an Nvidia GPU preflight passes
```

## Goal Exits

### MPS Parity Exit

MPS is parity-ready only when all of the following are true:

- MLX vs PyTorch CPU parity remains green on the established tiny reference suite.
- PyTorch CPU vs PyTorch MPS no-checkpoint forward, backward, optimizer, train/eval, and checkpoint-load probes pass within explicit tolerances.
- The MPS short trajectory keeps loss drift, parameter drift, gradient norms, and recurrent-state drift inside the documented parity envelope.
- The MPS memory probe shows flat or bounded memory behavior over the longest safe local probe.
- The trusted MPS path keeps `use_checkpoint: false`.
- Checkpointed MPS remains explicitly quarantined unless a later dedicated PR proves otherwise.
- No WT103, main-machine, production result, or `neo.csv` change is required for the parity claim.

### CUDA Transfer Exit

CUDA parity work is prepared but not validated in this repo because no Nvidia GPU is currently available. Reproducers must first run `NEO_RUN_CUDA_PROBE=1 python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_cuda_parity_harness.py` on a real Nvidia CUDA machine and confirm the optional CUDA test runs instead of skips. CUDA must pass full-precision, no-checkpoint, no-compile, no-fused-optimizer tests before speed features are considered.

## Global Rules

- Do not change MLX runtime semantics to match PyTorch.
- Do not weaken or remove existing MLX parity tests.
- Do not run WT103.
- Do not start production training scripts.
- Do not download large datasets.
- Do not modify `neo.csv`.
- Do not alter `configs/wt103/*` unless explicitly approved.
- Do not touch the main experiment machine.
- Do not write checkpoints or result artifacts outside pytest temp directories.
- Keep the passing PyTorch parity path on `use_checkpoint: false`.
- Keep checkpointed MPS outside scientific claims.
- Keep MPS/CUDA tests opt-in or skip-safe unless the runner is explicitly provisioned.
- Prefer test-first changes.
- Report exact local commands and GitHub Actions results in each PR body.

## Active PR Queue

No local implementation PR is active. The strict parity queue is empty after the
dependency reproducibility maintenance slice.

The next CUDA step remains external validation, not normal local development.
Before opening CUDA-result or CUDA-CI work, confirm an
Nvidia CUDA environment with:

```bash
NEO_RUN_CUDA_PROBE=1 python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_cuda_parity_harness.py
```

If this command skips because CUDA is unavailable, CUDA parity has not been validated. Standard GitHub-hosted runners for individual repos are not treated as Nvidia GPU runners for this project.

## Standing CI And Branch Protection Policy

Required checks should remain limited to currently available runners:

- Ubuntu tests
- macOS MLX parity

Do not add required CUDA CI while this project has no Nvidia GPU runner. Standard GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners for individual repos do not provide Nvidia CUDA hardware. A future CUDA workflow should be manual-only or optional until a real Nvidia runner is provisioned and explicitly approved.

Optional hardware probes remain local/manual:

- MPS: `NEO_RUN_MPS_PROBE=1 python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_mps_no_checkpoint_probe.py`
- CUDA: `NEO_RUN_CUDA_PROBE=1 python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_cuda_parity_harness.py`

## Parked Work

Do not hand these to an agent yet:

- WT103 reruns.
- Revalidating old PyTorch MPS result rows.
- Making MPS a production result backend.
- Re-enabling activation checkpointing for result production.
- Turning CUDA CI into a required branch protection check before an Nvidia runner exists.
- Editing `neo.csv` based on PyTorch runs.
- Introducing CUDA speed features such as AMP, TF32 changes, fused optimizers, `torch.compile`, or activation checkpointing before boring full-precision CUDA parity passes.
